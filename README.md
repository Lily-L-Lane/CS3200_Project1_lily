Welcome to my assignment! I designed an agricultural database that provides irrigation solutions. 
The Business requirement documents, UML, ERD, relational schema are self explanatory.
For the code, any file that is named after a table.sql is an insert SQL file. These populate the database with instances.
Any file with Project_Q# is a query and respective number. It will also state aspects of the query like "complex" etc. Comments at the top of each query tell you what it returns.
